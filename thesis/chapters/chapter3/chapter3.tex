\chapter{Detecting reverse shell traffic}

\label{chap:detection}

In this chapter, we examine the patterns and signatures characteristic of reverse shell traffic, laying the groundwork for developing possible detection algorithms. We add "layers" to how reverse shell connections can be disguised and so hidden from previous detection mechanisms.
